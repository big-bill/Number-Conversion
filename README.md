# Number-Conversion
project 2 for COP 2228

This program is a check writing simulation. The user will enter their name, a date (was unsure
if the date was suppose to be current, so I just set the minimum year to be 1950 and the max to
be 2016) and the check amount. The check amount can't be less than 0.1 or greater than 10,000.00.
This project was based on a chapter that dealt with string manipulation and c-strings. This was probably my least favorite project.

Project 2 description:


Check Writer
Write a program that displays a simulated paycheck. The program should ask the user to enter
the date, payee's name, and the amount of the check. It should then display a simulated check
with the dollar amount spelled out, as shown here:

Date 12/24/2012

Pay to the Order of: John Phillips...................$1920.85

One thousand nine hundred twenty and 85 cents

You may assume the amount is no greater than $10000. Be sure to format the numeric value of
the check in fixed-point notation with two decimal placees of precision. Be sure the decimal
place always displays, even when the number is zero or has no fractional part. Use either
C-strings or string class objects in this program.
